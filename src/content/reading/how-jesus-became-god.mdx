title: "How Jesus Became God: The Exaltation of a Jewish Preacher from Galilee"
printDate: "2014-03-25"
description: "Ehrman sketches Jesus's transformation from a human prophet to the Son of God exalted to divine status at his resurrection. Only when some of Jesus's followers had visions of him after his death - alive again - did anyone come to think that he, the prophet from Galilee, had become God. And what they meant by that was not at all what people mean today."
