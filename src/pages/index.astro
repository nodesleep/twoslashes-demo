      <h5>Introduction</h5>
      <p>
        Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in
        <a
          href="https://psychology.berkeley.edu/students/graduate-program/clinical-science"
          target="_blank">Clinical Psychology</a
        > at the University of California-Berkeley to study the human mind and how
        it responds to the world around us; seeking out new and innovative methods
        of discovery behind the ever-so-complex system of neurons, transmitters,
        and pathways. My undergraduate degree was a Bachelor of Science in
        <a href="https://eng.ua.edu/majors/computer-science-bs/" target="_blank"
          >Computer Science</a
        > from the University of Alabama and a Bachelor of Science in <a
          href="https://iou.edu.gm/stream/psy/"
          target="_blank">Psychology</a
        > from the International Open University.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to beginning graduate school, I spent nearly two decades as a
        software engineer in Silicon Valley, Startups, and Freelancing. I've
        created tools and companies to improve social media interactions and
        formed companies dedicated to Open Source; including OpenTeknik, the
        company responsible for the creation and ongoing maintenance of the <a
          href="https://www.opensource-socialnetwork.org/"
          target="_blank">Open Source Social Network</a
        >. I worked as an engineer for Apple, transitioning the MobileMe
        platform to what we call iCloud today. My most recent professional
        project being a fullstack developer for DFN Freight Exchange, where I
        joined the team and spearheaded development of <a
          href="https://www.dfnfreight.com/"
          target="_blank">DFNX</a
        >, their flagship freight exchange application built using TypeScript
        and Vue 3.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work has ranged from software engineering, to fullstack, to ui
        design. I&apos;ve worked as a consultant, contractor, and freelancer in
        all of these areas of expertise under my own LLC; building complex and
        robust web applications using JavaScript Frameworks. For the last year
        and a half, I&apos;ve been focused on my education and learning new
        languages; taking a special interest in Golang for systems programming
        and HTMX, the <a href="https://hypermedia.systems/" target="_blank"
          >Hypermedia library</a
        >. Paired together, they do an extremely wonderful job of eliminating
        the bloat that SPAs carry with them when used for the wrong application.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;ve also become increasingly fond of <a
          href="https://astro.build"
          target="_blank">Astro</a
        >. This website was made using Astro and Tailwindcss. You can view the
        source code <a
          href="https://github.com/nodesleep/twoslashes"
          target="_blank">here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m passionate about creating music, astronomy, space travel,
        psychology, and meteorology. I am the creator and maintainer of <a
          href="https://tornadotrax.com"
          target="_blank">TornadoTrax</a
        >, an application that shows the damage paths of US tornadoes between
        1950-2022. It includes valuable analytics assisting researchers and
        enthusiasts alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m always open to new opportunities and love discussing
        technology. If you find me on Twitter, you&apos;ll see I am very much
        communicative and posting regularly; typically engaging in the memes
        from HTMX or ranting with other engineers about the common stuff
        you&apos;d hear at the water cooler.
